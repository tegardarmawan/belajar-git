Anna, you come and ask you girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with her
(Anna)
Go with her
(Anna)
Anna, girl, before you go then
I want you to know then
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anna, just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anna, just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him
(Anna)
Go with him
(Anna)
You can go with him, girl
(Anna)
Go with him
